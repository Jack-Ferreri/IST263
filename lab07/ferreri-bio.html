<h1> Jack Ferreri Biography </h1>



<p>

    My name is Jack Ferreri, I am currently a Senior at <strong> Syracuse University </strong> the iSchool. My major is information management and technology with a focus in data analytics. 

</p> 

<h2> Personal information </h2>

<p> This summer I was lucky enough to have two different internships, one of them I was a marketing and sales intern for a small start up company while the other involved me tracking and analyzing NCAA baseball statistics. This was a great experience because sports analytics is why I got into data analytics to begin with. I am graduating this May and hope to find a career path that flows with data analytics. I am a massive Buffalo Bills fan unfortunately… I say unfortunately because it has only brought me pain and disappointment. I am also a massive Game of Thrones fan which also brought a bit of disappointment into my life because the last two seasons were awful in my opinion. </p>
